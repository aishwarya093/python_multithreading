#  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?
# Interpreted: Code is run step-by-step, making it slower but easier to fix mistakes (e.g., Python).
# Compiled: Code is turned into a machine language file before running, making it faster but less flexible (e.g., C++).

# What is exception handling in Python?
# It's a way to deal with errors so your program doesn't crash.


# In[4]:


# What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?
# A part of code that always runs, even if there's an error—good for cleanup like closing files.


# In[5]:


# What is logging in Python?
# Think of it as a diary for your program. It writes down what happens so you can find problems later.


# In[6]:


# What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?
# Called when Python removes an object from memory, like cleaning up before throwing something away.


# In[7]:


# What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?
# import: Brings the whole toolbox (module).
# from ... import: Brings just the tools you need.


# In[8]:


#  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?
# You can catch multiple types of errors by listing them together or handling them one by one.


# In[9]:


# What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?
# It’s like a contract: it opens a file for you and ensures it’s closed when you're done.


# In[10]:


#  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?
# Multithreading: Doing many tasks in one process (good for waiting tasks like downloads).
# Multiprocessing: Running tasks in separate processes (good for heavy work like math calculations).


# In[11]:


# What are the advantages of using logging in a program?
# Helps you figure out what happened in your program when things go wrong.


# In[12]:


# What is memory management in Python?
# Python automatically manages memory for you, like cleaning up unused stuff.


# In[13]:


# What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?
# Wrap risky code in try.
# Handle specific errors with except.
# Run extra code if there’s no error with else.
# Clean up with finally.


# In[15]:


# Why is memory management important in Python?
# Keeps your program from wasting memory or slowing down.


# In[16]:


# What is the role of try and except in exception handling?
# try: Test for errors.
# except: Fix or handle the error if it happens.


# In[17]:


#  How does Python's garbage collection system work?
# Python gets rid of unused objects to free up memory.


# In[18]:


# What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?
# else Block:
# Runs code only if no error happens.


# In[19]:


# What are the common logging levels in Python?
# DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL: Different levels of how serious the message is.


# In[20]:


# What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?
# os.fork(): A basic tool to create a new process.
# Multiprocessing: A fancier tool that works everywhere.


# In[21]:


# What is the importance of closing a file in Python?
# To avoid issues like losing data or locking the file.


# In[22]:


# What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?
# read(): Reads everything.
# readline(): Reads one line.


# In[23]:


# What is the logging module in Python used for?
# Used to keep a record of what happens in your program.


# In[24]:


# What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?
# Helps you work with files and folders, like creating or deleting them.


# In[25]:


#  What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?
# Issues like using too much memory or leaving unused stuff behind.


# In[26]:


#  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?
# You can create your own error using raise, like saying, “This is wrong!”


# In[27]:


# Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?
# It keeps things moving when your program is waiting for something (like loading a webpage).
